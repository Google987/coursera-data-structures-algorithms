# Puzzle: Two Rocks Game

I found this Practice Quiz quite hard and tricky. Also couldn't find any good explanation for this game. 
Still I would sugget to at least try for 30 - 60 mins on your own. If you are still not able to figure out the solution, go through the below explation. 



```
- Pick from pile which has odd number of rocks. 
- If both pile have same number of rock then pick from both pile. 
```
